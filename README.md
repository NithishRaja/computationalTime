# Computational time measurement

Computation time required for each step mentioned in [H.F. Huang, K.C. Liu, A new dynamic access control in wireless sensor networks, in: IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference, APSCCâ€™08, Yilan, Taiwan, 2008.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4780791) is calculated and stored

## Setup
* create `./data` directory in root of project
* to generate trials, run `node hash.js`
* to get averages, run `node average.js`

## Editing code
* Time measuring code is in `hash.js` file
* Code to average data is in `average.js` file
* Configuration parameters are in `config.js` file

## Features
* Data for each trial is stored in a file inside `.data` directory
* Average values are stored inside `.data` directory
